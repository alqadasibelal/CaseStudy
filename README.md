## BRIEF DESCIPTION
A point of sales system or (POS). It is a system where the customers 
in the shopping site or physical store make their payment of their 
purchase for products or services and where sales taxes may become 
payable. Every time they purchase they will complete the point of 
the sales transaction.
For our case study. we developed a mobile application using 
react-native where the customer or user will input the 
product/service/ item name, the price of the item, quantity, and 
lastly if the product has a discount. Customers will press add to 
cart to enter more items and their details to the system. Lastly, 
It calculate the total amount of the products to be paid, customers 
will press on Total button.
